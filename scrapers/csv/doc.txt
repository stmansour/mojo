CSV IMPORT

1. Get the CSV file to import
2. Add a line below the CSV file's first line. Each column must contain the name
   of the Mojo CSV input column header that the column in the first line maps to.
   It may be empty if there is no mapping.
3. Import the data indicating the group (-g), creating the group if necessary (-cg),
   and specifying the intput file with -f.
4. ./test/csv has a working example of this
