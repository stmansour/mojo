How To Use Mojo

1.  Add your message / images / attachments to the campaigns directory
    in ./test/mailsend/campaigns

2.  Update the group of people as needed. That could mean (a) rescanning
    the FAA contacts or (b) importing a csv file.  Store the csv file in
    the same campaign directory.  To import a csv use the following:

    Fix up the supplied csv file. Most of the time the csv file supplied has
    issues.  Do some global changes first, and save to g.csv

        ""   ->  "
        ^" *([^,]+), *([^"]+)",(.*)    -->   "\1","\2","\3"
    
        LC_ALL=c sort -f -u g.csv > g1.csv
        LC_CTYPE=C && LANG=C && uniq g1.csv > g2.csv
    
    Update g2.csv. Typically the columns will be:

        "LastName",FirstName,Email1


    To initialize all the queries and required groups:
    	./mailsend -setup

    To import a csv file use a command like this:

        ./mojocsv -g groupname -cg -f xyz.csv

        example:

        ./mojocsv -g ibguests20180102 -cg -f guniq.csv

    where

        -g is followed by the name of the group you want to send the email to
        -cg means create the group if necessary
        -o means don't print the time statistics associated with this import
        -f is followed by the csv file to import

        example:
        ./mojocsv -g ibguests20171206 -cg -f prevgest.csv

3.  Validate the email addresses in the group you'll send to and make any
    fixes necessary:

        ./mailsend -validate ibguests20180212

    
4.  To test the send capability, send a message to MojoTest (the group
    or the query).
    
    ./mailsend -from x@y.com -b msg.html -subject "Test Message" -group MojoTest
    

CSV File Format
	The first row should be the column titles of all the data below
	The secont row should be the name of the Mojo DB Person field to which it maps.
