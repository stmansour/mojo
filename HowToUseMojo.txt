How To Use Mojo

1.  Add your message / images / attachments to the campaigns directory
    in ./test/mailsend/campaigns. Under the campaigns directory, go to
    the appropriate company (for example, isola) then create a directory
    for the date the campaign will run. Example 2018-05-31 for May 31,
    2018. Put all the files associated with the campaign into this
    directory.

2.  Update the group of people as needed. That could mean (a) rescanning
    the FAA contacts or (b) importing a csv file.  Store the csv file in
    the same campaign directory.  To import a csv use the following:

    Fix up the supplied csv file. Most of the time the csv file supplied has
    issues.  Do some global changes first, and save to g.csv

    (a) Remove consecutive quote marks

        ""   ->  "
        """  ->  "

    (b) Properly quote every line
        (ensure that regular expressions are turned on)

        ^" *([^,]+), *([^"]+)",(.*)    -->   "\1","\2","\3"
                                        OR   "$1","$2","$3"    if you're using Atom

        sublime example:
        set to regular expressions (.*)
        Find:     ^" *([^,]+), *([^"]+)",(.*)
        Replace:  "\1","\2","\3"

        If there are extra fields that we don't need, remove the commas
        in the source.  For example:

            "Abagire, Edward",amy.brummett@faa.gov,,,

        must be changed to

            "Abagire, Edward",amy.brummett@faa.gov

        so

            ,,,$  -> [nothing; blank]

    (c) Save to g.csv

    (d) Make sure that environment variables are set correctly then
        run the csv through sort and uniq to remove duplicates.

        LC_ALL=c sort -f -u g.csv > g1.csv
        LC_CTYPE=C && LANG=C && uniq g1.csv > g2.csv

    (e) Update g2.csv so that it can be imported into mojo.
        Typically the columns definitions on lines 1 & 2 will be:

        LastName,FirstName,Email1

        CSV File Format
        The first row should be the column titles of all the data below
        The second row should be the name of the Mojo DB Person field
        to which it maps.


        To initialize all the queries and required groups:

    	../../../../../mailsend -setup

    (f) Before importing the csv file into memory, look for the common
        errors in email addresses.  Examples:

        josephinnbolen@gmail       fix is to append ".com"
        Getatcheckin               set it to ""
        tony.burometto@faagov      set it to faa.gov
        john.d'elisa@faa.gov       remove '
        Noemail.com                set it to ""
        yomkippor77msn.com         should be @msn.com
        Ryan.t.baldwain@.com       no way to know, set it to blank ""

    (g) The script ./tools/bashtools/fixcommon.sh will correct many
        of the issues.  It expects its input to come from g2.csv and
        will send its output to g3.csv.

            ../../../../../tools/bashtools/fixcommon.sh

    (h) To import a csv file use a command like the one below. It
        will create the group for the import:

            ./mojocsv -g groupname -cg -f xyz.csv

        example run from an Isola Bella campaign directory (change the name
        of the group to be whatever is appropriate):

            ../../../../../tmp/mojo/mojocsv -g ibguests20180531 -cg -f g3.csv

        on a production system:

            ../../../mojocsv -g ibguests20180531 -cg -f g3.csv

    where

        -g is followed by the name of the group you want to send the email to
        -cg means create the group if necessary
        -o means don't print the time statistics associated with this import
        -f is followed by the csv file to import

3.  Validate the email addresses in the group you'll send to and make any
    fixes necessary:

        ../../../../../tmp/mojo/mailsend -validate ibguests20180531

    This will produce a list of invalid addresses.  You can copy the PID column
    and create a quick query and edit the remaining in MySQLWorkbench.  The query
    will be something like this:

        SELECT * FROM People WHERE PID IN (328, 767, ...blablabla)

4.  Update the following files

        msend.sh
        msg.html
        plsapprove.html

    then install them on both production machines in the campaign directory.

        Steves-MacBook-Pro-2:2018-05-31 sman$ smcp msend.sh dir3:~/
        Steves-MacBook-Pro-2:2018-05-31 sman$ smcp msend.sh dir4:~/
        Steves-MacBook-Pro-2:2018-05-31 sman$ smcp msg.html dir3:~/
        Steves-MacBook-Pro-2:2018-05-31 sman$ smcp msg.html dir4:~/
        Steves-MacBook-Pro-2:2018-05-31 sman$ smcp plsapprove.html dir3:~/
        Steves-MacBook-Pro-2:2018-05-31 sman$ smcp plsapprove.html dir4:~/

    then on dir3 and dir4 from the campaigns/... directory

        [ec2-user@ip-172-31-56-225 2018-05-31]$ mv ~/msg.html .
        [ec2-user@ip-172-31-56-225 2018-05-31]$ mv ~/msend.sh .
        cp msend.sh ../../../


5.  First, run mailsend with the setup option so that all the test users
    will have their status cleared if they had previously opted out.

        ./mailsend -setup

6.  Test the send capability, send a message to MojoTest (the group
    or the query). Update the msend.sh script from the campaigns directory
    and uncomment the lines that send the message to the MojoTest group.
    Then simply execute msend.sh

7.  If everything looks correct then update msend.sh again. Comment out
    the lines that send to MojoTest. Uncomment the lines that send to
    AccordTest.  Then execute msend.sh

8.  After approval from Michelle, uncomment the line that sends the
    message to the entire group and run msend.sh again.

9.  Log into the Amazon AWS SES console and monitor the stats.

10. IF YOU NEED TO RESEND A MESSAGE TO A FEW PEOPLE because their email
    addresses were incorrect, you can use the -pid option on mailsend.
    *  First, fix the email addresses in the database and make sure
       that the FLAGS are cleared.
    *  Next, make a quick list of the PIDs of the people you want to
       send to.
    *  use the -pids option on mailsend to list the PIDs of the
       recipients, no spaces.  Ex:  -pids 7366,8829,29922
    *  or you can use the mailto option to list the email addresses of
       the people you want to send the message to.  Example:
       -mailto sman@stevemansour.com,stmansour@gmail.com,sman@accordinterests.com
