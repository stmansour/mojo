How To Use Mojo

1. Add your message / images / attachments to the campaigns directory
   in ./test/mailsend/campaigns

2. Update the group of people as needed. That could mean (a) rescanning
   the FAA contacts or (b) importing a csv file.  Store the csv file in
   the same campaign directory.  To import a csv use the following:

   Remove the column header information if it exists -- save it to another file.

   cat xyz.csv | ../../../../../tmp/mojo/charnorm | sort -f | uniq > guniq.csv

   Now that the sorting is finished add the column names as appropriate, and add
   another line below the column names with the fields that they map to in Mojo.


To initialize all the queries and required groups:
	./mailsend -setup

To import a csv file use a command like this:

    ./mojocsv -g groupname -o -cg -f xyz.csv

    example:

    ./mojocsv -g ibguests20180102 -o -cg -f guniq.csv

where

    -g is followed by the name of the group you want to send the email to
    -cg means create the group if necessary
    -o means don't print the time statistics associated with this import
    -f is followed by the csv file to import

    example:
    ./mojocsv -g ibguests20171206 -cg -f prevgest.csv

3. Validate the email addresses in the group you'll send to:



CSV File Format
	The first row should be the column titles of all the data below
	The secont row should be the name of the Mojo DB Person field to which it maps.
