How To Use Mojo


To import a csv file use a command like this:

    ./mojocsv -g groupname -o -cg -f xyz.csv

where

    -g is followed by the name of the group you want to send the email to
    -cg means create the group if necessary
    -o means don't print the time statistics associated with this import
    -f is followed by the csv file to import

    example:
    ./mojocsv -g ibguests20171206 -cg -f prevgest.csv


CSV File Format
	The first row should be the column titles of all the data below
	The secont row should be the name of the Mojo DB Person field to which it maps.
