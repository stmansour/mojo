<p>Hi {{.P.FirstName}},</p>
<p>This message has been sent to everyone in the AccordTest group by Mojo.
As part of the test group, you will receive a test message shortly for an
upcoming campaign.
Please check the message content, links, and anything else you can think of.
You can try the unsubscribe link if you like.  I will always reset the status
of everyone in the test group prior to sending a test message, so you will
always receive the test email even if you opt-out.</p>
<p>Please reply to <strong>this message</strong> to let me know if everything looks OK or
if there are problems. Be careful not to reply to the <strong>test message</strong>
because the sender will not be me.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Steve<br>
